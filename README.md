# credit-card-fraud-detection
Implemented and compared XGBoost and LSTM models, evaluating their performance on a dataset with 280,000+ transactions.
SMOTE was applied to create synthetic samples for the minority class (fraud transactions).
LSTM outperformed XGBoost, achieving near-perfect fraud detection with a 99.95% accuracy and nearly 1.00 AUC score
